Welcome to my project! The tech stack is currently Next.js, Tailwind, Recharts, and Vercel. We are using Finnhub for our stock data and you will need to get an api key from there to run locally. It does not use any machine learning or ai, currently it is just getting data from Finnhub and displaying it (creating an ai seems out of the project scope for a simple screening question). Hope you like it!
